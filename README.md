This is the app that was created by following the instructions given by the prework section in CodePath.
This app lets users input their name, school, how many pets they have, and if they would like more pets.
After inputting all the information, the user is able to click the button at the bottom of the screen.
Doing so will result in an alert pop-up that gives an introduction about the user with the information that was given.
